#How to play

The objective of the game is to make the character reach the water without touching the bugs that pass by the road

- Use the keyboard arrows to move the character

- Every time you reach the water your score increases by one

- When you hit a bug the game is reset

- As time passes the game becomes harder (more and faster bugs)

- The game will keep a record of the best score.
